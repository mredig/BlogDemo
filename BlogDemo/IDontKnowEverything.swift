	This class represents something like a tableView that needs data or a UI item that can customize its behavior. It could also be something like a network class that runs in the background and informs its delegate when data fetching is completed.

	Delegates are simply a pattern of one class not quite having the whole picture and needing some information filled in. You may wonder why these things aren't set via properties, but often times properties just don't cut it, for example when you want to let another class know to react (like updating a list) after a network transaction.

		The power of this method is allowing for you to have a GIGANTIC dataset, but still have your tableView run at extremely smooth speeds since it only loads enough data for what's on screen and then recycles its cells for reuse (that's what the whole `dequeueCellForReuse` is about)
