# Blog Demos

This repository is where I'll share my sample code from my [blog](https://mikespsyche.com). 

I intend to keep everything in one repo and simply make a new branch extended from master for every new sample. Hopefully this isn't eventually tedious!

With that stated, if you're only interested in a single sample, simple switch to the appropriate branch and download the zip file. If you'd like to check them all out, I'd recommend cloning the repository so that you can just checkout whichever branch interests you most for any purpose.

If you're not on the master branch and you're having issues, please switch over to the master to see if the readme there has been updated. I don't intend to push out all readme updates to all branches.


Additionally, all code in this repository is MIT licensed, unless stated otherwise. The license file is located only in the master branch, but applies to all branches (again, unless noted otherwise).
